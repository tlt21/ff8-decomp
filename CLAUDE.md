# ff8-decomp

## Core Rules

- **No hack build steps.** The build must be a straightforward compile-and-link. Do not add extra build steps (fixup scripts, binary patching, post-processing, etc.) to work around mismatched output. If the output doesn't match, the decompiled code itself needs to be fixed — not papered over with build pipeline hacks. This is the #1 rule of the project.
- **No proprietary data in the repo.** This is an open source project. ROMs, ISOs, and any extracted proprietary content must never be committed. Users provide their own copy of FF8 Disc 1.
- **Document code with Doxygen.** When decomping or touching functions, add Doxygen-style comments (`/** ... */`) describing what the function does, its parameters, and return value. If you're not fully certain of a function's purpose, give your best estimation and note the uncertainty (e.g. `@note Purpose uncertain — appears to ...`).
- **Verify the build before pushing.** Before running `git push`, always run `rm -rf asm && make split && make verify` and confirm that every target shows `Match`. Do not push if any target shows `Mismatch`, `Skip`, or `build failed`.
- **Never tag a function as non-matching.** Do not add `@note Non-matching` comments or otherwise classify a function as permanently non-matching. Every function should be treated as solvable — keep experimenting with different approaches, use the permuter, or leave it as INCLUDE_ASM until a match is found.
- **Write code a human would write, not reverse-engineered code.** The goal is to produce source that looks like it was written by a developer in 1998, not transliterated from assembly. Use simple `for` loops with array indexing (`g_gameState.itemSlots[i].id`), not manual pointer arithmetic with goto labels (`ptr++; if (i < N) goto top;`). Use `count--` not `count = count - 1`. Use struct field access with natural expressions. If your code has raw casts, goto-based loops, or manual pointer walking where a for loop and array index would do, rewrite it. Ask: "would a human have written this?" — if not, simplify.
- **Externs, typedefs, and structs go in header files.** Any `extern` data symbol, function prototype, `typedef`, or `struct`/`union` definition that may be referenced from more than one translation unit must live in the appropriate header (`battle.h`, `field.h`, `world.h`, `menu.h`, `gamestate.h`, `gf.h`, `common.h`, etc.). Do not define a typedef inside a `.c` file or declare an extern at file scope unless the symbol is *truly* private to that one translation unit (file-scope `static` is fine). Multiple `.c` files defining their own incompatible view of the same memory (e.g. several `D_800ED148_Type`/`BattleState` typedefs aliased to the same address) is a code smell — pick the canonical struct, put it in the header, and have everyone use it.
- **Hoist as you go.** When touching a `.c` file, opportunistically move any file-scope externs/typedefs/structs that belong in a header into the right header. Don't leave decay in place. If a typedef in the file you're editing duplicates or partially shadows one already in a header, unify on the header version and delete the local one (verify the build matches after).

## Decomp Tools

### permute.sh (decomp-permuter)

Automatically tries C source permutations to find a byte-matching decomp. Use this when a function is close but has register allocation, scheduling, or instruction ordering differences that are hard to solve by hand.

```bash
# Setup only (creates permuter/<func_name>/ with base.c, target.s, compile.sh):
./permute.sh --src src/ovl/menutest/menutest.c \
    --asm-dir asm/ovl/menutest/nonmatchings/menutest \
    func_801E64B4

# Setup + run (tries random permutations):
./permute.sh --run -j4 --src src/10DD0.c --asm-dir asm/nonmatchings/10DD0 func_80022B04

# PsyQ 4.3 functions:
./permute.sh --psyq 4.3 --src src/34C8.c --asm-dir asm/nonmatchings/34C8 func_80014E98
```

The permuter modifies variable ordering, casts, expression structure, etc. in `base.c` and compiles each variant, looking for one that matches `target.o`. When it finds a match (score 0), copy the winning C back into the source file.

The compile pipeline uses `/usr/bin/cpp → tools/gcc-2.7.2-cdk/cc1 → maspsx → mipsel-linux-gnu-as`, matching the build system and decomp.me's `gcc2.7.2-cdk` preset.

### decomp-index (cross-project search)

Searches 9+ PS1 decompilation projects (~10K functions) for assembly patterns similar to a given function. Use this when stuck on a decomp pattern — other projects may have solved the same idiom.

```bash
# Find functions with similar assembly to a given .s file:
python3 -m decomp_index.cli --db ~/source/decomp-index/decomp.db \
    search asm/ovl/menutest/nonmatchings/menutest/func_801E64B4.s

# Show a specific function's assembly + C source:
python3 -m decomp_index.cli --db ~/source/decomp-index/decomp.db \
    show <project> <func_name>

# Find recurring instruction idioms:
python3 -m decomp_index.cli --db ~/source/decomp-index/decomp.db idioms
```

## Decomp Methodology

- **Define and extend structs as you go.** When decomping a function that accesses memory not yet covered by a struct, define the struct (or add fields to an existing one) rather than using raw pointer offsets. Discovered fields should be named meaningfully when their purpose is known, or `unkXX` / `padXX` (where XX is the hex offset) when unknown. Padding arrays (`u8 pad04[12]`) are acceptable placeholders for regions not yet understood, but the struct itself must exist and cover the full accessed range. Never leave a known memory access as a raw `*(u8 *)(base + 0x1C3)` when a struct could express it — add the field to the struct first, then access it by name.

- **Write code as a 1998 developer would have written it.** The goal is source code that looks like it was written by a human in 1998, not reverse-engineered. This means:
  - Use proper structs, enums, and `#define` constants — no raw pointer arithmetic, no magic hex offsets where a named constant or struct field is appropriate.
  - Use natural numeric literals: decimal for counts, sizes, and game values a programmer would think in (`100`, `152`, `9999`); hex only where the original programmer clearly would have (`0xFF`, `0x8000`, bitmasks, hardware addresses).
  - Prefer named enums or `#define`s for values that have semantic meaning (command types, ability IDs, status flags, etc.).
  - Raw pointer offsets and `(s32)&g_gfData`-style arithmetic are **last resorts only** — used solely when struct/typed access provably breaks matching codegen, and only in the specific statement that requires it. All surrounding code should still use proper types.
- **Experiment with compiler flags when stuck.** If a function doesn't match with the file's default flags, try different `-G` values (`-G0`, `-G4`, `-G8`, or no `-G` flag) and `-O` levels. The correct flags for a source file may differ from what's currently in the Makefile — the build config was reverse-engineered and may need adjustment. Test on decomp.me or locally.
- **Check the `-G` flag impact.** Without `-G0`, CC1PSX emits pseudo-instructions for global access (e.g. `sh $0, sym`) that GAS expands using `$at`. With `-G0`, CC1PSX does its own expansion using `$v0`/`$v1`. If the original uses `$at` for global stores, the function was likely compiled without `-G0`.
- **Use unsized arrays to prevent GP-relative access.** `extern u8 g_gameState[];` (unsized) forces CC1PSX to self-expand addresses with delay slot filling, matching the original 3-instruction `lui/jr/addiu` pattern. Sized globals may use GP-relative addressing depending on `-G` flag.
- **Use structs and proper data types.** Access data through struct fields rather than raw pointer offsets — this affects compiler scheduling and alias analysis, often producing different (and correct) codegen.
- **Try goto-based loops.** When `while`/`for`/`do-while` loops produce wrong code (LICM, strength reduction, base-offset folding), try `top: ...; if (cond) goto top;` which GCC 2.7.2 doesn't recognize as a loop.
- **Use compound assignment and casts to control leaf register allocation.** When a leaf function has a v0↔v1 swap or wrong temp register, try: (1) `s16 tmp = arg;` to force a narrowing copy into a specific temp, (2) compound assignment inside the store expression (`sym.field = (tmp &= 0x1FFF);`) to tie the mask and store together, (3) `(u32)var >> N` cast to force `srl` instead of `sra`, (4) struct field access on the global (`D_SYM.field = val;`) instead of raw pointer offsets — this changes which register gets the base address vs the computed value. Example (func_800A4B68): `s16 tmp = arg0; s32 tmp2 = arg0 & 0xE000; D_800ED148.unk12E0 = (tmp &= 0x1FFF); tmp = ((u32)tmp2) >> 0xD; D_800ED148.unk130F = (s8)tmp;` — the compound `tmp &= 0x1FFF` inside the store, separate `tmp2` for the upper bits, and direct struct access all combine to produce the exact register allocation.
- **Use `volatile` to prevent load narrowing.** CC1PSX narrows `lw` to `lbu`/`lhu` when it can prove the destination is a narrow type (e.g. storing to an `s8` field). If the original assembly uses `lw`, declare the source struct/variable as `volatile` (e.g. `extern volatile GameState g_gameState;`) — this forces the compiler to use the full-width load. Example: func_80030248 in btl_color.c.
- **Don't prematurely classify functions as non-matching.** Scrambled prologues, interleaved saves, and unusual register allocation are often solvable with the right variable declaration order, assignment patterns, or casts — they just require more experimentation. func_8009B6D0 was wrongly classified as non-matching for months before a different variable assignment pattern (`new_var = arg0; temp = new_var; if (new_var < 0) temp = new_var + 0x7FF;`) produced the exact prologue interleaving. When stuck, try the permuter or decomp.me before giving up.

## Setup Workflow

Before any development can happen, a contributor must:

1. **Provide your own ISO** — Place your FF8 Disc 1 ISO at a known path (e.g. `disc/ff8.bin`).
2. **Extract data from the ISO** — Run a setup step that pulls the game executable and relevant files out of the disc image.
3. **Run splat** — Use [splat](https://github.com/ethteck/splat) to split the extracted executable into assembly (.s) files and data segments, which form the baseline to decompile against.
